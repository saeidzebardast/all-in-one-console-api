{"name":"All in one Console API","tagline":"","body":"# All in one Console API\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## What's Console API?\r\n\r\nThe Console API provides web applications with methods for writing information to the console, creating JavaScript profiles, and initiating a debugging session.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Non-standard\r\nsee [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console)\r\n\r\n>\r\nThis feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.\".\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n\r\n### console.log(object[, object, ...])\r\nWrites a message to the console. You may pass as many arguments as you'd like, and they will be joined together in a space-delimited line.\r\n\r\n### console.debug(object[, object, ...])\r\nWrites a message to the console, including a hyperlink to the line where it was called.\r\n\r\n### console.info(object[, object, ...])\r\nWrites a message to the console with the visual \"info\" icon and color coding and a hyperlink to the line where it was called.\r\n\r\n### console.warn(object[, object, ...])\r\nWrites a message to the console with the visual \"warning\" icon and color coding and a hyperlink to the line where it was called.\r\n\r\n### console.error(object[, object, ...])\r\nWrites a message to the console with the visual \"error\" icon and color coding and a hyperlink to the line where it was called.\r\n\r\n### console.assert(expression[, object, ...])\r\nTests that an expression is true.  If not, it will write a message to the console and throw an exception.\r\n\r\n### console.clear()\r\nClears the console.\r\n\r\n### console.dir(object)\r\nPrints an interactive listing of all properties of the object.\r\n\r\n### console.dirxml(node)\r\nPrints the XML source tree of an HTML or XML element.\r\n\r\n### console.trace()\r\nPrints an interactive stack trace of JavaScript execution at the point where it is called.\r\n\r\nThe stack trace details the functions on the stack, as well as the values that were passed as arguments to each function.\r\n\r\n### console.group(object[, object, ...])\r\nWrites a message to the console and opens a nested block to indent all future messages sent to the console. Call <code>console.groupEnd()</code> to close the block.\r\n\r\n### console.groupCollapsed(object[, object, ...])\r\nLike <code>console.group()</code>, but the block is initially collapsed.\r\n\r\n### console.groupEnd()\r\nCloses the most recently opened block created by a call to <code>console.group()</code> or <code>console.groupCollapsed()</code>\r\n\r\n### console.time(name)\r\nCreates a new timer under the given name. Call <code>console.timeEnd()</code> with the same name to stop the timer and print the time elapsed.\r\n\r\n### console.timeEnd(name)\r\nStops a timer created by a call to <code>console.time(name)</code> and writes the time elapsed.\r\n\r\n### console.timeStamp(name)\r\nCreates a time stamp.\r\n\r\n### console.profile([title])\r\nTurns on the JavaScript profiler.\r\n\r\n### console.profileEnd()\r\nTurns off the JavaScript profiler and prints its report.\r\n\r\n### console.count([title])\r\nWrites the number of times that the line of code where <code>count</code> was called was executed.\r\n\r\n### console.exception(error-object[, object, ...])\r\nPrints an error message together with an interactive stack trace of JavaScript execution at the point where the exception occurred.\r\n\r\n### console.table(data[, columns])\r\nAllows to log provided data using tabular layout.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## More info\r\n* [developer.chrome.com](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console-api)\r\n* [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console)\r\n* [getfirebug.com](https://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
